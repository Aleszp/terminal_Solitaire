# terminal_Solitaire
A Solitaire game to be played in text-mode (like ubuntu terminal) written in C language (std C99).

Very basic program, aimed to work in any OS that may compile C language code. Intended to use in GNU/Linux (Lubuntu) and DOS-like systems.
In future versions may use ncurses library.

Farewell and have fun :).
